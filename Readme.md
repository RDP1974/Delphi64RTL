A common Delphi web framework tested with apachebench and 100 concurrent users (vm windows 2022 intel 9900k)<br>
(This enhancement is achieved in highly threaded apps doing concurrent memory and search operations)<br>
<br>
About zlib IPP accelerated: you can use symbolic name Z_IPP_FAST_COMPRESSION which is equal to -2<br>    
Introduced new sub-ranges of compression levels from 11 to 29<br>
The standard levels 1..9 are compatible with original Zlib<br>
Levels 11..19 are similar to 1..9, but fit better when compressing large files (more than 1 MB)<br>
Levels 21..29 are for highly compressible files with compression ratio equal to 30x and higher
<br><br>
If you want enable accelerated zlib programmatically into your WebBroker app, just add one line of code in afterdispatch event:

- procedure TWebModule.WebModuleAfterDispatch(Sender: TObject; Request: TWebRequest; Response: TWebResponse; var Handled: Boolean); 
- begin 
- Response.ZlibDeflate;
- end;

The library is well tested, run on Intel and Amd x64 Windows, if you found any trouble please notify me;<br>
big thanks to the Delphi community and its great coders, in particular for the support received from Bruno Fierens (TMS), Daniele Teti (bittime), Arnaud Bouchez (mormot) and many others.<br>
